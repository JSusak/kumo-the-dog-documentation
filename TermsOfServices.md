# Kumo The Dog Terms of Services

## Intended Usage
By inviting Kumo to your server and using its various commands, you agree to the terms outlined in this document, as well as the subsequent privacy policy, for Kumo The Dog.
Kumo can be freely distributed onto any Discord Server in which you either own or have "Manage Server" rights for. Consequently, if you are found breaking the terms/policy of Kumo The Dog or the Discord [Terms of Services](https://discord.com/terms)/[Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)/[Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), this permission would get revoked.

If at any point you do not agree to these terms you must immediately discontinue the use of this bot.

Once Kumo has been invited to a server, the bot may start to collect some data, some temporary and some indefinitely, as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Temporary data is used for checking the current voice channels/text channels that Kumo is in and Indefinite data relates to the storing of user IDs in a secure mongoDB database that only the developer can access.

## Underage Users

As also stated in the Privacy Policy, the usage of Kumo The Dog is not condoned for any users under the age of 13 or who do not meet the age of digital consent in their country and has not verified with a trusted parent/legal guardian, in conjunction with the Discord [Terms of Services](https://discord.com/terms). If it is found out that user data has been stored for an underage user, steps will be taken to ensure that their ID will be removed from the database.

## Liability of Breaking Rules

The developer of Kumo asks that the bot is NOT used in a way which is:
- Unethical and unfriendly.
- Hateful and misleading.
- Abusive and threatening.
- Unresourceful, hitting the various rate limits.


Kumo's owner (@Saracen#6210) cannot be held liable for any users who choose to misuse the bot or break any rules outlined in Kumo's Terms of Services or Privacy Policy as well as Discord's various documents. Saracen trusts that users who choose to interact with the bot do so in a friendly, non-harmful manner!

## Affiliation 

Kumo The Dog is not made by or supported in any way by Discord directly. Any similarities to objects which have already been trademarked by Discord are completely coincidental and Saracen holds no responsibilities or claims for owning any pieces of property made by Discord.

Please do not claim my code as yours. If you choose to create clones of the bot purely for the attempt to get verified rather than experimentation **you will get a DMCA notice.**
