# Kumo The Dog Privacy Policy
By including Kumo The Dog in your server, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy correlating to the collection of Discord values, specifically those of user IDs and channel IDs.

## Accessing User Data
Sensitive user and channel IDs will only ever be accessed by the developer of Kumo and only used in the boundaries of testing, debugging and implementing new features for Kumo. Channel IDs are NOT saved anywhere and are only used in the context of recognising the current locations of Kumo (The current Voice channels, referred to as 'Kumo Channels' in the code and Text channels). The lifetime of which a Voice Channel ID is stored is the moment that Kumo joins until its disconnection.

## Saving Data for Global Leaderboards
User IDs are placed into a highly secured mongoDB database for the sole purpose of updating their corresponding total message count (increases by one whenever a user interacts with Kumo) When a user first uses the bot, a new 'entry' is recorded and saved into the database and is stored INDEFINITELY throughout the lifetime of the bot. The database is only used for the /leaderboard command, in which new positions in the leaderboard are calculated and the usernames of the TOP 5 global users are shown to anyone who uses it, WITHOUT exposing their discriminator. For any inquiries pertaining to the storage of user IDs in the database or for any requests of deletion, you are free to join the support server and message @Saracen#6210 directly.

## Rights to the deletion of saved data
As mentioned above, feel free to join the support server at any time and DM @Saracen#6210 for questions relating to the removal of stored user data.

## Users not permitted to use Kumo
The usage of Kumo The Dog is not condoned for any users under the age of 13 or who do not meet the age of digital consent in their country and has not verified with a trusted parent/legal guardian, in conjunction with the Discord Terms of Services. If it is found out that user data has been stored for an underage user, steps will be taken to ensure that their ID will be removed from the database.

## Further Questions
For any additional questions relating to how your sensitive data is stored, don't hesitate to message @Saracen#6210 on Discord!
